Frequently Asked Questions about the SUBMITC ISPF edit macro
------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Why does it say "command not found" when I invoke as "SUBMITC"?
A. You need to let ISPF know it's a load module, put a "!" before
   the command is in "Command ===> !SUBMITC"

Q. Why does it say "command not found" when I invoke as "!SUBMITC"?
A. The load module SUBMITC needs to be in the normal search order.

Q. Why did I get a S0C4 and/or S66D ABEND?
A. You probably typed in "!SUBMIT" and not "!SUBMITC".  !SUBMIT would
   invoke IBM's SUBMIT command and it goes bonkers if invoked as an
   ISPF edit macro.

Q. Why did SUBMITC not prompt me for a password every time it finds
   "?" on a line?
A. Please read the $$README file, SUBMITC only handles passwords in
   certian situations.

Q. Why did SUBMITC not translate my symbolic as expected?
A. Two reasons off hand:
   1) Symbol process was not active for the line.  See the $$README
      for how to get it turned on
   2) Maybe the symbolic isn't defined to the system. Issue the
      "D SYMBOLS" command in SDSF or on the console to see the list.

Q. Is there a way to use it outside of an edit macro so I can replace
   SUBMIT?
A. I've created an exec called SUBMITCE that will invoke VIEW (like
   EDIT but no update) on a given dataset and it specifies !SUBMITC as
   the intial edit macro.  Sample usage:

   TSO SUBMITCE 'IBMUSER.DAVE.CNTL(IEBGENER)'

Q. Why does SUBMITCE leave me in VIEW/EDIT on the dataset?
A. I can't give SUBMITC a parm like "END" and I don't want to write
   a special SUBMITC that does an END.  Here's how to get around that:

   TSO SUBMITCE 'IBMUSER.DAVE.CNTL(IEBGENER)';END

Q. How can I avoid having to put the silly SUBMITC::SYM control card
   in the jobstream?
A. You can invoke SUBMITC with parm SYM to do the substitution on all
   lines of the jobstream as in "!SUBMITC SYM".  This is not supported
   with the SUBMITCE exec.
